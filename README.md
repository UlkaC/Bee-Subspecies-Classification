# Bee-Subspecies-Classification
This project presents a thorough exploration of a dataset comprising annotated images of bees captured across diverse locations in the United States. The dataset spans several months, includes images taken at various hours, features multiple subspecies of bees, and showcases different health problems. The primary objective of this study is to employ machine learning techniques for the classification of bee subspecies and to develop a robust model capable of generalizing to new, unseen data.The insights gained from this contribute not only to the field of bee image classification but also to the broader understanding of machine learning in ecological studies. As technology continues to advance, the intersection of machine learning and environmental monitoring holds great potential for addressing crucial ecological challenges.
